Python Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python. The game allows a user to play against the computer. The computer makes random moves without any AI logic. The game is played on the console, and the board is displayed after each move.

Features
The game board is displayed as a 3x3 grid.
The user plays with 'O' and the computer with 'X'.
The computer's first move is placed in the middle of the board.
The user enters their move by selecting a number from 1 to 9.
The game checks for valid inputs and prevents overwriting occupied squares.
The game determines if the player or the computer wins, or if it's a tie.
The computer's move is chosen randomly from available free squares.
The game ends when there's a winner or when the board is full.
How to Play
Run the Python script to start the game.
The computer will make the first move (middle of the board).
Enter your move by selecting a number from 1 to 9.
The computer will make its move after yours.
Continue until a player wins or the game ends in a tie.
